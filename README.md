Project: Models of Observational learning 
Year: 2015-16

This project contains private code for modeling the behavior of animals in an auditory discrimination task.
(If someone needs a useable matlab implementation of any of the algorithms, let me know)

Types of algorithms implemented:
1. Actor-critic based Reinforcement Learning (RL) with softmax policies in discrete state space (https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node66.html)

2. Value function approximation (TD (0)) https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node86.html
for continuous state spaces (discrete action space)

3. Apprenticeship learning (Neu and Szepesvari 2007 paper): How to learn the policy followed by an expert demonstrator?

4. Perceptrons and logistic regression for classification and regression. 

5. Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis
